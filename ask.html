			<dt class="category">Our dog, Sparky, likes to eat whatever the kids are snacking on.
								Is it OK for the dog to eat chocolate?</dt>
				<dd>
					Chocolate is toxic to dogs. Please do not feed your dogs chocolate.
					Try playing a game with your children &mdash; when you feed them people treats, they can feed
					Sparky dog treats.
